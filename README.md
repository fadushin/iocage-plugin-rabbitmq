# iocage-plugin-rabbitmq

This [iocage](https://iocage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) plugin can be used to create a [FreeBSD](https://freebsd.org) jail with a running instance of [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com).

A single administrative user (`admin`) is created.

The RabbitMQ [Management plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) is enabled, allowing a web-based interface to manage the RabbitMQ instance.
